# Classical Mashup

This repository contains the code used for my MPhil research project: "Classical Music Mashup with Music Theory-Informed Algorithms and Generative AI". The project aims to develop a system that can generate mashups of classical music pieces by using music theory-informed algorithms and generative AI. The system is implemented in Python, implements a note-based system for representing piano music that can be converted to WAV, MIDI, and music score. The system uses the music21 library for music theory operations.
